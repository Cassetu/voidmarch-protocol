# Contributing to Voidmarch Protocol

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Voidmarch Protocol**. This project is an indie, open‑development civilization / simulation game, and contributions of all kinds are welcome.

This document explains how to get started, what kinds of contributions are most useful, and the expectations for collaboration.

## Project Overview

**Voidmarch Protocol** is a simulation‑driven strategy game focused on planetary expansion, technology progression, and emergent systems. The project is actively evolving, and many systems are intentionally modular to make collaboration easier.

Primary technologies currently include:
- JavaScript (core logic)
- HTML / Canvas rendering
- Modular game systems (world, units, buildings, rendering layers)

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork** locally.
3. Open `index.html` in a browser or run a local static server.
4. Make your changes in a new branch.

If something is unclear, open a **GitHub Issue** or start a **Discussion** — questions are welcome.

## Issues and Task Selection

- Look for issues labeled:
  - `good first issue`
  - `help wanted`
- If you want to work on something not listed, **open an issue first** describing what you plan to do.
- Avoid duplicating work already in progress.

---

## Code Style & Practices

- Keep code **modular and readable**.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Use existing file structure and patterns when possible.
- Comment non‑obvious logic.
- Avoid large, unrelated changes in a single pull request.

---

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

### Commits
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
  - Example: `Add population growth scaling system`

### Pull Requests
- One feature or fix per pull request.
- Describe **what you changed** and **why**.
- Reference any related issues.
- Be open to feedback and iteration.

Pull requests may be requested to change structure or style before merging.

---

## Communication & Conduct

- Be respectful and constructive.
- Critique ideas, not people.
- This is a collaborative learning‑friendly project.

Harassment, discrimination, or hostile behavior will not be tolerated.

---

## Credit & Attribution

- All contributors will be credited.
- Significant contributions may be acknowledged in‑game or in documentation.
- By contributing, you agree that your work may be included in the project under its license.
