# Voidmarch Protocol

**Voidmarch Protocol** is an experimental, simulation-driven strategy game focused on civilization growth, planetary expansion, and emergent systems. The project emphasizes systemic interaction over scripted gameplay, allowing complex behavior to arise from relatively simple rules.

This repository represents an active, evolving codebase. Systems are intentionally modular and subject to change as the project matures.

## Project Status

* **Development Stage:** Early / Active Development
* **Stability:** Experimental
* **Audience:** Developers, designers, and collaborators interested in simulation and strategy systems

Expect incomplete features, refactors, and breaking changes.

---

## Core Concepts

* Planet-based civilization simulation
* Population, resource, and production systems
* Modular buildings and units
* Technology and progression systems
* Emergent behavior through interacting subsystems

The long-term vision is a scalable framework capable of supporting multiple planets, expanding technologies, and increasingly complex civilizations.

---

## Technology Stack

* JavaScript (ES6+)
* HTML5 / Canvas rendering
* Modular game architecture
* Runs entirely in the browser

No build tools or frameworks are required at this stage.

---

## Running the Project

You can run the game locally with minimal setup:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cassetu/voidmarch-protocol.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser **or**
3. Serve the directory using a local static server for best results.

A live version may also be available via GitHub Pages.

## Repository Structure (High-Level)

* `world/` – World state and simulation logic
* `player/` – Player data and progression
* `renderers/` – Rendering layers and visual output
* `systems/` – Core simulation systems
* `assets/` – Visual or audio resources

Structure may evolve as systems expand.
